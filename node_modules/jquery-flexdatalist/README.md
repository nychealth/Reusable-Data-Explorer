## Demo & Documentation ##

## Roadmap

- Improve accessibility
- Allow the search to be disabled on flexdatalist and just use the given list (from server-side)
- Use CSS grid to list multiple selected values
- Regex in JS has bad support for special and accented characters, I'll try to make some improvements (it works since v2.3.0, but it won't highlight the word, though)
- Make it jQuery independent (this will take a while to make it to a release)
