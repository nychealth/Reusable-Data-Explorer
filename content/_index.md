Asthma is a common disease in which the lungs become swollen, making breathing difficult. The exact causes of asthma are not known.

Asthma is a leading cause of emergency room visits, hospitalizations and missed school days in New York City's poorest neighborhoods. In NYC, asthma is more common among low-income Black and Latino children.

### Asthma and the Environment

Certain things in the environment can trigger an asthma attack or make symptoms worse. Common triggers include smoking; dust mites, cockroaches, and mold; pollen; pests; and air pollution. 

### Controlling Asthma

Asthma does not have to prevent you from leading an active and healthy life. You can take charge by avoiding asthma triggers:

- Check the weather report daily for air pollution level ("air quality index") and pollen counts. Limit time outside when air pollution levels or pollen counts are high.
- If you smoke, [quit](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/smoking-how-to-quit.page "NYC Quits"). Don't allow smoking in your home or car.
- Work with your landlord to fix leaks promptly to prevent mold. If your landlord fails to fix the problem, call 311.
- [Pest proof your home](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/pests-and-pesticides.page). If building conditions may be attracting pests, contact your landlord. If your landlord does not address your concerns, call 311.
